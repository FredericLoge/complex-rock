# Python Data Viz course 

@ ENSAE, CEPE, Dec 1st 2025.

# Install

I used python version >= 3.10. I recommend you do the same.

If you have poetry installed, then you can run `poetry install` and all required packages will then be installed.

If you do not have poetry installed, and would like to proceed without, then here is then I let you check the list of packages to install manually in `pyproject.toml`. 

Be aware that the chosen versions have their importance as some packages tend to change a lot and therefore syntax may break from one version to another.

# Course content

Slides can be found in folder `slides`, notebooks and python scripts in `scripts` and dashboard in `apps`.
